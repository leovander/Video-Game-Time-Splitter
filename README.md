Video Game Time Splitter
========================
This is an overly glorified stop watch that keeps track of video game run times for speed runs.

The HTML is written in proper HTML5 syntax, passing the [W3C Markupvalidation Service](http://validator.w3.org/). The only thing I would change is to make the two main `<div>`'s into `<section>`'s to follow the sematics of HTML5.

It uses localStorage to save different run times locally, and has the following dependencies:
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [JavaScript Stopwatch Class](http://www.seph.dk/blog/projects/javascript-stopwatch-class/)
